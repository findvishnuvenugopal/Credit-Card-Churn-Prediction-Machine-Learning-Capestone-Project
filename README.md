# Credit-Card-Churn-Prediction-Machine-Learning

Introduction A churn model is a mathematical representation of how churn impacts your business. Churn calculations are built on existing data (the number of customers who left your service during a given time period). A predictive churn model extrapolates on this data to show future potential churn rates.

Churn is a scourge on subscription businesses. When your revenue is based on recurring monthly or annual contracts, every customer who leaves puts a dent in your cash flow. High retention rates are vital for your survival.

Building a predictive churn model helps you make proactive changes to your retention efforts that drive down churn rates. Understanding how churn impacts your current revenue goals and making predictions about how to manage those issues in the future also helps you stem the flow of churned customers. If you don’t take action against your churn now, any company growth you experience simply won’t be sustainable.

A business manager of a consumer credit card bank is facing the problem of customer attrition. They want to analyze the data to find out the reason behind this and leverage the same to predict customers who are likely to drop off.
